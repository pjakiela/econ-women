This is just a list of notes for a future user of this system.

A few schools have separated their tenure-track and non-tenure-track facutly on their websites,
namely:

Michigan State
Duke

So we're not concerned about the titles of Professors at these schools



Sometimes, schools don't use unique tags for Professor names, so I had to manually
subset the professor names. This is why you'll see negative indices in some places.
In these cases, manual adjustments may need to be made to the Professor



Michigan State displayed the names of its Professors in quite a strange way, hence all of
the weird functions. Please reach out to jcp4@williams.edu if you need any explanation here.

Not sure what to do about Yale's 'Secondary Faculty' -- I think one or two others
have this same category

Couldn't get title names for USC, but it shouldn't matter because they all appear to be faculty


Issue with UCSD: Inconsistent formatting wrt title -- some in ul and li tags and other in p tags
